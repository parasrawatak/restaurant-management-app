# Restaurant Management System

## Description

The Restaurant Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the operations of restaurants, providing an efficient platform for managing both restaurant details and employee information. The system facilitates the creation, editing, and deletion of restaurants and employees, as well as the assignment of employees to specific restaurants.

## Features

- **Restaurant Management**: Users can add new restaurants, view existing ones, update restaurant details, and delete restaurants when necessary. Each restaurant entry includes essential information such as name, location, seating capacity, and amenities like terraces and parking availability.

- **Employee Management**: The system allows for the addition, viewing, modification, and removal of employees associated with the restaurants. Employee records include details such as first name, last name, hire date, and restaurant affiliation.

- **Assignment of Employees**: Managers can assign employees to specific restaurants, ensuring efficient staffing and organization within each establishment.

- **Basic Input Validation**: The application includes basic validation for input fields to maintain data integrity and accuracy. This ensures that only valid data is accepted for restaurant and employee records.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture that enhances code reusability and maintainability. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the frontend components, offering a utility-first approach to CSS.

- **Backend**: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a robust server-side framework for handling HTTP requests, routing, and data management.
